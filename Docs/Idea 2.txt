	Game title:		Magic Castle

	Story:
	

An ancient legend passed from generation to generation tells of twelve warriors who, over 2000 years ago, defeated Rhyos, the Dragon of Apocalypse, and then used the sacred power of twelve mythical artifacts to magically seal him for the next 2000 years deep within the underground chamber of a huge abandoned castle that once belonged to a very wealthy royal family, which ruled Avalar until the Great War erupted and wiped out most of the human race.
