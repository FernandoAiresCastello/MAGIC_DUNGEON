	Game title:		Void Explorer
	
Space exploration game where there is a huge galaxy, and randomly generated planets.

Story:
	The Earth has suffered a cataclysmic event that extinguished almost the entire human race, and the Earth is no longer habitable. Since you were on a space station with some other astronauts, you have escaped that fate, but now stranded in space, you will need to find the resources to survive and try to populate other habitable planets.

The game works in "flick-screen" fashion, where the scene doesn't "scroll", but rather the player advances to the next "screen" by moving beyond the current scene boundaries or accessing some kind of passage that leads directly to another scene.

There is a finite "oxygen" meter that gradually and slowly depletes with time. If it reaches 0, it's game over.
It's possible to replenish the oxygen meter by finding specific items around the planets visited or by going back to the base.
It's also possible to increase maximum oxygen capacity by finding specific specific items.

There are breakable rocks all over the planets that once broken reveal hidden items.

The player
	Carries a laser gun as a weapon.
	Can also fight melee using saber swords that can be obtained for money.

The player's gun
	Initially very basic, with very limited ammo, range and destructive power.
	Can be upgraded, which will increase ammo capacity, range and destructive power.

The player's armor
	It's a spacesuit which can be upgraded for better defense attributes and larger oxygen tanks.

Random points:
	Each planet can have a different size, but the size is randomly selected from a specific set of possible sizes.
	Planet size is measured by the amount of "screens" it's divided into.
	The minimum planet size is 1 (i.e. a single screen)
	The maximum planet size is 25 (i.e. a 5x5 scene layout)

	Each planet can have different graphical elements and different color palette, depending on its type.
